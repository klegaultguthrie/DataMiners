# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Our project will use Pandas and Python for data cleaning, manipulation, integration and analysis. 

## Database Storage
After cleaning and analyzing our data, we will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) RDS to connect to a local PostgreSQL server to store our data using SQLAlchemy. We will then use a Postgres query to join the data and further connect it to our Machine Learning Model. 

## Machine Learning


## Dashboard
We will use Tableau as our main interactive dashboard tool. Tableau is intuitive and relatively simple to use. It will also allow us to interact with the data in the dashboard in real time. May use javascript & HTML if needed as well for more interactivity.
